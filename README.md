# Unity Tools

## State

This work is 100% based on the [toptalent](https://www.toptal.com/unity-unity3d/unity-ai-development-finite-state-machine-tutorial) blog post by [Garegin Tadevosyan](https://www.toptal.com/resume/garegin-tadevosyan). I am only slightly modifying some naming conventions and adding in some other examples. FSM are everywhere and this package is being used to help a Game Studies & Design course in Unity.

## Setup & Design

FP_State is a simple [Finite State Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)

## Dependencies

Please see the [package.json](./package.json) file for more information.
